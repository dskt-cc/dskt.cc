description: Understanding Desktop Mate's file organization
---

## Overview

Desktop Mate organizes its files in several key directories. Understanding this structure is essential for mod development and troubleshooting.

## Root Structure

```plaintext
GameFolder/
├── Desktop Mate.exe
├── UserData/
├── Mods/
├── UserLibs/
└── VRM/
```

## Mods Folder

```plaintext
GameFolder/
└── Mods/
    ├── ModName1.dll
    └── ModName2.dll
```

This folder contains all your installed mods. MelonLoader will automatically load any .dll files placed here when the game starts.

## UserLibs Folder

```plaintext
GameFolder/
└── UserLibs/
    ├── Assembly-CSharp.dll
    ├── UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
    ├── UnityEngine.UI.dll
    └── Other Dependencies.dll
```

The UserLibs folder contains game assemblies and dependencies required for mod development. These files are automatically generated by MelonLoader and are essential for:

- Mod development references
- IDE IntelliSense support
- Debugging and development tools

## UserData Folder

```plaintext
GameFolder/
└── UserData/
    ├── Config/
    │   ├── MelonLoader.cfg
    │   └── mod_settings.json
    ├── Logs/
    │   ├── MelonLoader.log
    │   └── Latest.log
    └── Saves/
        └── user_preferences.json
```

Stores user-specific data including:

- Mod configurations
- MelonLoader settings
- Log files
- Save data

## VRM Folder

```plaintext
GameFolder/
└── VRM/
    ├── model1.vrm
    └── model2.vrm
```

## Development Tips

- Always reference assemblies from the UserLibs folder in your mod projects
- Keep the Logs folder clean by regularly clearing old log files
- Back up your UserData folder before making major changes
- Use version control for your mod development
