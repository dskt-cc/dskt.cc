## Hiding MelonLoader Console

To launch Desktop Mate without the MelonLoader console:

1. Right-click Desktop Mate in Steam
2. Select Properties
3. Go to Launch Options
4. Add: `--melonloader.hideconsole`

## Common Issues

### .NET Runtime Issues

If you see `il2cpp_init detour failed: It was not possible to find a compatible framework version`:

- Make sure you have **.NET 6.0** installed specifically
- Earlier or later versions will not work
- Download from the official Microsoft website

### MelonLoader Version

Always use MelonLoader version 0.6.6:

- Avoid nightly builds
- If F4 file explorer doesn't open, reinstall MelonLoader 0.6.6
- Some keyboards may require pressing `Fn + F4`

### File Explorer Issues

If F4 file explorer isn't working:

1. Ensure MelonLoader 0.6.6 is installed
2. Try `Fn + F4` if your keyboard requires it
3. Check file placement:
   - Don't put Mods and UserLibs inside the pre-existing mods folder
   - Place them directly in the Desktop Mate folder

### Model Issues

- Invalid file errors may occur with Cyrillic characters in file paths
- Physics issues (hair, clothes) are common with some models
  - VRoidHub models often have better physics
  - Short hair and simple clothing typically work better
- "Mikuspin" glitch (character rotating):
  1. Switch to default character using DM menu
  2. Reselect your character with F4 browser

### Transparency Issues

If the console is transparent instead of the character:

1. Try closing and reopening
2. Keep focus on avatar while loading
3. Update GPU drivers
4. For NVIDIA users:
   - Disable FXAA and MFAA for Desktop Mate in NVIDIA Control Panel

### Log File Management

To prevent excessive logging:

1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Enter: `%userprofile%\appdata\locallow\infiniteloop\desktopmate`
3. Open log files in a text editor
4. Clear contents
5. Set files to read-only
